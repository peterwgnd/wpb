To prioritize the development of Columbia Business School’s new website, the executive steering committee has approved a freeze on the development of new sites and features in Drupal 7.

## What this means

To give the web development team the necessary resources and time to focus on building the new website, we’re putting a stop to the development of new features and websites in Drupal 7. It is also critical that we keep the web environment as stable as possible as we review and assess 
This does not impact the content of any site. You should (and, likely, must!) continue to update and create new content in our sites. Content can be moved and reorganized across our site portfolio.
The development team will continue to prioritize system updates, bug fixes, and ongoing maintenance. If you encounter any problems with our site, please reach out to [web@gsb.columbia.edu](mailto:web@gsb.columbia.edu) or fill out our [contact form](/contact).

## Should I hold my requests for the time being?

No! Please don’t hesitate to reach out and share any thoughts, ideas, or requests you might have for the site. There’s a great deal that can be accomplished within our current platform without requiring the time of our development team. It’s also helpful for us to know about our users’ desired features sooner rather than later, so please send any and all thoughts you have on the site to [web@gsb.columbia.edu](mailto:web@gsb.columbia.edu) or fill out our [contact form](/contact).

We will make every effort to accommodate all requests within our existing platform. If, for any reason, we are unable to accommodate a request, or to come up with an acceptable stopgap, you can request an exception to the freeze, which will be referred to the executive steering committee for consideration.

## If my exception request is denied, when will it be addressed?

If, after consideration, the executive steering committee votes to deny an exception to the freeze, you will be notified by a member of the web project team.

Unless the steering committee determines the feature or site request to be inappropriate or out of scope, your feature or site request will be added to a list of desired features for our new site, and will be addressed as we work on related functionality in the new site build. A member of the web project team will contact you as soon as the feature has been scheduled to determine final requirements and to schedule time for testing and to ensure the new feature meets your needs.
